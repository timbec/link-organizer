For link preview (possibly complicated): https://andrejgajdos.com/how-to-create-a-link-preview/
Another one (might be out of use. Can't believe this isn't more a feature):

POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL FEATURES:

- along with single links:
  1. links that are grouped by similarity - for example links related to the same product I want to look at later.
  2. links grouped together as I currently fill out textedit docs with links - for a certain project, or an idea/project to research later.

Bugs, problems along the way:
originally error message 'deprecated', and page stopped loading:
