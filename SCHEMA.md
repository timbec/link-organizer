# Lnkr Schema Setup:

## Links for personal use:

- group in categories (not predetermined, but set with each link as per WordPress):

  - recipes
  - web development
  - news
  - etc.

  In addition, should be able to group in sub-categories within each category. For example:

  - recipes:

    - Asian
    - French
    - Vegeterian
    - etc . . .

  - Also includes tags (Wordpress, Thai, etc)
  - All this will be useful later on for use as an API.

  ## Work

  - group links by project.

    - can have sub-groups within each project. Like having multiple textedit pages, applying to each project. Maybe they could even appear like this eventually.

  - For example:

  - **Millenium:**

    - Front End
    - Javascript
    - SASS
    - etc.

  - these can also be categorized and tagged as per links for personal use. These will also appear in the personal section. Links that are NOT categorized and tagged will not appear.

  - All the above will be searchable, which might involve the API.

## Phase II

- another component of work section might be notes/code snippets, which would make it more of an explicit tooling box.
